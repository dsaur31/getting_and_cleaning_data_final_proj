Final project for Coursera Data Science Course: Getting and Cleaning Data


run_analysis.R runs the following script on data downloaded from this link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
Creates a second, independent tidy data set (final_data.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Codebook.md offers descriptions of the original dataset, more details of the changes made in run_analysis.R and a table of variable names, descriptions and general stats.
